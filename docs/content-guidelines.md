# Kind Content guidelines

We'd like to clarify that these guidelines are only effective on the
UserStyles.world website.


## Purpose

UserStyles.world("USw") encourages their users from anyone who wishes to
add/import/review/explore UserCSS styles("styles"), to be able to do so.
People shouldn't feel discouraged from participating in this community.

In order to ensure the safety and quality of styles, we encourage anyone
to make a conscious effort into following these guidelines
to the best of their ability.

We'd like to note and clarify that actions[ยน](#footnote) will be taken
to ensure the safety and quality of the USw platform.

These guidelines suggest specific ways to accomplish that goal.


## Guidelines

- As a platform that hosts UserCSS styles, USw highly discourages to host/post
    other content then UserCSS styles. 

- USw allows hosting screenshot(s) of your style(s), please try to reflect
    this screenshot to show how your style looks like when applied.

- As noted, USw hosts screenshot(s) for their styles, please remember that not
    everyone is of consent age in their respective country, therefore
    we discourage the usage of not safe for work ("NSFW") images
    for these screenshot(s).

- Please, when you're writing a review of a style, give constructive feedback
    which will help the author improve the style.
    USw discourages writing reviews that are based on feedback which doesn't
    help the author improve the style.
    
- Please, remember that you don't have to write
    a review if you don't want/have to.

- Please, recognize that criticism/feedback of your styles is not
    a personal attack on you.

- Please, don't raise unrelated topics/off-topic while writing a review.

- Please, don't use the review/feedback system to report bugs. While these help
    the author, this system is not the correct way to report them. Try to 
    contact the author and check for a support URL in the UserCSS style.

- Please don't upload styles that discriminate against certain groups of people

- Please don't try to post other people's content, but if you do, ensure that
    the license of the original content allows this.
    USw highly discourages posting other people's work if their license is not
    permissive of it. Also, please, try to give credit to the original author.

## Footnote

1. To clarify "actions", we say that trusted users and admins have the
   ability to remove styles/users if they heavily and/or repeatedly violate
   these guidelines. This is to accomplish the goal explained in [purpose](#purpose).
   This is how UserStyles.world tries to enforce these guidelines.
