# Kind Communications Guidelines

We'd like to clarify that these rules is 
not in relation to the site https://userstyles.world.
But rather in relation of the open-source community spaces 
around the code repository.

This Code of Conduct/Guidelines is a modification 
of the [GNU Kind Communcations Guideline](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.html).

## Purpose

UserStyles.world("USw") encourages contributions from anyone who wishes to
advance  the development of the USw platform, regardless of gender, race,
ethnic group, physical appearance, religion, cultural background,
and any other demographic characteristics, as well as personal political views.

People could feel being discouraged from participating in USw development,
because of certain patterns of communication that strike them as unfriendly,
unwelcoming, rejecting, or harsh. This discouragement particularly
affects members of disprivileged demographics, but it is not limited to them.
Therefore, we ask all contributors to make a conscious effort, 
in USw-related discussions, to communicate in ways that avoid the outcome.
To avoid practices that will predictably and unnecessarily risk putting 
some contributors off.

These guidelines suggest specific ways to accomplish that goal.


## Guidelines

- Please assume other participants are posting in good faith, even if you
  disagree with what they say. When people present code or text as their own
  work, please accept it as their work. Please do not criticize people for
  wrongs that you only speculate they may have done.

- Please think about how to treat other participants with respect, especially
  when you disagree with them. For instance, call them by the names they use,
  and honor their preferences about their gender identity[1][#footnote].

- Please do not take a harsh tone towards other participants, and especially
  don't make personal attacks against them. Go out of your way 
  to show that you are criticizing a statement, not a person.

- Please recognize that criticism of your statements is not a personal 
  attack on you. If you feel that someone has attacked you, or offended 
  your personal dignity, please don't “hit back” with another personal attack.
  That tends to start a vicious circle of escalating verbal aggression. 
  A private response, politely stating your feelings as feelings, and asking
  for peace, may calm things down. Write it, set it aside for hours or a day,
  revise it to remove the anger, and only then send it.

- Please avoid statements about the presumed typical desires, capabilities
  or actions of some demographic group. They can offend people in that group,
  and they are always off-topic in USw-related discussions.

- Please be especially kind to other contributors when saying they made 
  a mistake. Programming means making lots of mistakes, and we all do so—this
  is why regression tests are useful. Conscientious programmers make mistakes,
  and then fix them. It is helpful to show contributors that being imperfect
  is normal, so we don't hold it against them, and that we appreciate their
  imperfect contributions though we hope they follow through by fixing any
  problems in them.

- Please respond to what people actually said, not to exaggerations
  of their views. Your criticism will not be constructive if it is aimed at
  a target other than their real views.

- If in a discussion someone brings up a tangent to the topic at hand,
  please keep the discussion on track by focusing on the current topic
  rather than the tangent. This is not to say that the tangent is bad, or not
  interesting to discuss—only that it shouldn't interfere with discussion of
  the issue at hand. In most cases, it is also off-topic, so those interested
  ought to discuss it somewhere else.

- If you think the tangent is an important and pertinent issue,
  please bring it up as a separate discussion, with a Subject field to fit,
   and consider waiting for the end of the current discussion.

- Rather than trying to have the last word, look for the times when there is
  no need to reply, perhaps because you already made the relevant point
  clear enough. If you know something about the game of Go, this analogy might
  clarify that: when the other player's move is not strong enough to require a
  direct response, it is advantageous to give it none and instead move elsewhere.

- Please don't argue unceasingly for your preferred course of action when a
  decision for some other course has already been made. That tends to block
  the activity's progress.
    
- If others have irritated you, perhaps by disregarding these guidelines,
  please don't excoriate them, and especially please don't hold a grudge
  against them. The constructive approach is to encourage and help other
  people to do better. When they are trying to learn to do better, please
  give them plenty of chances.

- If other participants complain about the way you express your ideas, please
  make an effort to cater to them. You can find ways to express the same points
  while making others more comfortable. You are more likely to persuade others
  if you don't arouse ire about secondary things.

- Please don't raise unrelated political issues in USw-related discussions,
  because they are off-topic.


## Footnote

By making an effort to follow these guidelines, we will encourage more
contribution to our projects, and our discussions will be friendlier and
reach conclusions more easily.

Honoring people's preferences about gender identity includes not referring to
them in ways that conflict with that identity, and using specific pronouns
for it when those exist. If you know someone wishes to be considered male,
it is best to use the masculine pronouns for him. If you know someone wishes to
be considered female, it is best to use the feminine pronouns for her. Otherwise,
use gender-neutral pronouns, since at least they don't conflict with anyone's
gender identity. One choice is singular use of “they,” “them” and “their.”.
